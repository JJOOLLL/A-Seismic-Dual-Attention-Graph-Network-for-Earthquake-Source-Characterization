# A-Seismic-Dual-Attention-Graph-Network-for-Earthquake-Source-Characterization
This repository contains the code, data processing scripts for the paper “A Seismic Dual-Attention Graph Network for Earthquake Source Characterization.” The study proposes a dual-attention graph neural network that integrates spatial and temporal dependencies in seismic data to improve earthquake source localization and parameter estimation.
